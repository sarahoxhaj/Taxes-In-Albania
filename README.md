# Taxes-In-Albania

#### This is a project about taxes in Albania using RStudio and statistics over the years from INSTAT (Institute of Statistics).
To visualize the data that was collected, I made a presentation in R Markdown and a Shiny Web App with R Studio.

By looking at this project we can see :
* The connection between GDP and taxes.
* Tax rates over the years and their effect on society.
* Differences between Balkan and European countries according to tax rates and different types of taxes.
* Types of taxes that have changed the most over the years.
* Fields in which we pay the most taxes and where the government should invest more.
